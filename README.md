# SQLiteRecognizer

This repository contains the code for a recognizer and a negative sample generator for the language SQLite.




Both tools rely on an ANTLR parser, the parser found in  `src/gen` was generated with the SQLite grammar found in the files `grammar/SQLiteLexer.g4` and `grammar/SQLiteParser.g4`.

The negative sample generator is based on the word mutation method described by Raselimo, Taljaard and Fischer in their paper _Breaking parsers: mutation-based generation of programs with guaranteed syntax errors_ [[1]](#1).
